### Hi, I’m Kaja. 
#### I build brands, stories, and digital experiences that *look good*, *feel right*, and *perform* — a mix of marketing strategy, creative direction, content, and cultural curiosity.

This repository hosts my portfolio website: selected projects, experiments, and the kind of work I’d love to do more of.

### What you’ll find here
- Creative marketing projects & concepts  
- Content, brand thinking, and campaign ideas  
- A few “digital craft” case studies (yes, sometimes that includes SEO — but it’s not the headline)

### My work style
I’m happiest where **creative meets structured**: moodboards + messaging frameworks, intuition + research, aesthetics + metrics.  
I care about tone of voice, visual identity, and the little details that make something feel premium — whether it’s a landing page, a concept, or a content universe.

### A few of the things I’m good at
- Creative strategy & content direction (from concept to execution)
- Brand & messaging: positioning, narrative, audience thinking
- Creating and improving digital experiences (web + content journeys)
- Data-informed marketing decisions (without killing the vibe)
- International collaboration, stakeholder communication, and crisp reporting
- Tools: GA, GSC, SEMrush, Screaming Frog, Ahrefs, Looker, ChatGPT, Microsoft Office, and the usual creative-tool chaos

### Background (the short version)
I’ve worked across in-house and agency environments — including SIXT, GA Agency, and EPROFESSIONAL / Havas Media — on international projects with a strong focus on growth, content, and digital performance.

### The fun facts (because portfolios should have personality)
- I’ve lived in **three countries** — and moved to **two of them without visiting first**
- I’ve **jumped out of a plane** (proof that I can commit to a bold idea)
- As a kid I had **6+ hobbies at once**, which explains my love for art, style, variety, and learning fast

#### Contact
If you’re looking for someone who blends **marketing sense + creative taste + digital know-how**, let’s talk.  
You’ll find contact options on the live portfolio site (and via LinkedIn).
